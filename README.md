These are two additional APIs utilized to stress test the results of Respector

The first API is written using NodeJS and ExpressJS
However, Respector only runs using Java APIs. This unfortunately means that prior progress was not meaningful

The second API is written in Java using Maven
This API carries 40 routes divided evenly amongst Post, Put, Get, and Delete html calls
With previous progress halting the development process, this API was unable to be tested within Respector
